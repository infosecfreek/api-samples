This repository contains samples for the `siem` endpoint of the API.

These samples are provided for reference purposes on an "as is" basis, and are without warranties of any kind.

It is strongly advised that these samples are not run against production systems.

Any issues discovered using the samples should not be directed to QRadar support, but be reported on the Github issues tracker.

# Siem Samples
Scripts in this directory demonstrate how to use the `siem` endpoints of the API.


For a list of the endpoints that you can use along with the parameters they
accept you can view the REST API interactive help page at
`https://<hostname>/api_doc`.  You can also retrieve a list of available
endpoints through the api itself at the /api/help/capabilities endpoint.


Access to the Offense API endpoints requires a user or authorized token with a
role that contains both the following privileges:

 * Offenses


The scripts in this directory include:

### 01_GetOffenses.py
In this sample, you see how offense data is retrieved with the `siem` API, and how to use
the `fields` and `filter` parameters and the `Range` header to make the data retrieved concise
and easy to read.  
For this scenario to work there must already be offenses on the system the
sample is being run against.  
The scenario demonstrates the following actions:

- How to get offenses.
- How to filter the data that is returned with the `fields` parameter.
- How to filter the data that is returned with the `filter` parameter.
- How to page through the results using the `Range` parameter.

### 02_HideOffenses.py
In this sample, you see how to retrieve offenses and have the user select one, and
retrieve information from that offense. The sample concludes by showing how to change
the status of an offense using the `POST` endpoint and the `status` field.  
For this scenario to work there must already be offenses on the system the
sample is being run against.  
**This sample will make changes to the offense it is run against.**  
The scenario demonstrates the following actions:

- How to get offenses with the status `OPEN` using the `filter` parameter
- How to get a single offense given the ID
- How to decode data received and access the information
- How to hide an offense

### 03_ShowOffense.py
This sample shows how to "show" an offense as specified by QRadar. It operates in
a manner similar to sample 02.  
For this scenario to work there must already be offenses on the system the
sample is being run against.  
**This sample will make changes to the offense it is run against.**  
The scenario demonstrates the following actions:

- How to get offenses with the status `HIDDEN` using the `filter` parameter
- How to get a single offense given the ID
- How to decode data received and access the information
- How to show an offense

### 04_Notes.py
In this sample, you see how notes on offenses work, and how to display notes and
create new ones using the `siem` API.  
For this scenario to work there must already be offenses on the system the
sample is being run against.  
**This sample will make changes to the offense it is run against.**  
The scenario demonstrates the following actions:

- How to get offenses
- How to get a single offense given the ID
- How to get notes from an offense
- How to make a new note for an offense

### 05_ClosingReasons.py
This sample shows how to display closing reasons, and create custom ones.
**This sample will make changes to the offense it is run against.**  
The scenario demonstrates the following actions:

- How to get a list of closing reasons
- How to create a new closing reason

### 06_ClosingAnOffense
In this scenario we will be closing an offense in a system similar to how the
the user can close offenses in QRadar. This has four main processes.

  1. Select an offense
  2. Select a closing reason
  3. Modify `status` to `CLOSED`
  4. Leave a note

For this scenario to work there must already be offenses on the system the
sample is being run against.  
**This sample will make changes to the offense it is run against.**  
The scenario demonstrates the following actions:

- Using `filter` and `field` parameters with `GET` endpoints to retrieve a comprehensive list
- Selecting objects with `GET` from known lists of things with specific properties
- How to post notes on an offense
- How to close an offense

### 07_ManagingOffenses.py
Here we will be showing an example of how to manage offenses and users. 
The example shows how to assign offenses to people given the IP addresses
of the destination_networks, and a way to keep up to date on which offenses
need to be closed soon, and which offenses should have been closed by now.

This sample uses a file (default assignment_data.csv)containing the data 
in the format:  
`name,destination_network,days_to_close`
with commas separating the elements.
For this sample to work all names must be existing users on the system
and there must already be offenses on the system the
sample is being run against.  
THIS SAMPLE WILL MAKE CHANGES TO THE OFFENSES IT IS RUN AGAINST  
The scenario demonstrates the following actions:

- Using siem/offenses GET with filters and fields parameters
- Using data returned by API calls
- Assigning offenses using rules assigned in a separate file
- Managing offenses by assigning them to separate users and using their creation date to enforce a timetable for dealing with them.

### 08_GetOffenseAddresses.py
Here we will be showing an example of how to get all source addresses and
local destination addresses for an offense. For this scenario to work there
must already be offenses on the system the sample is being run against.

The scenario demonstrates the following actions:
 - Using GET siem/offenses with filters and fields parameters
 - Using the output from siem/offenses to build filter criteria to be used
   with the GET siem/source_addresses and GET
   siem/local_destination_addresses endpoints.
 - Using the GET siem/source_addresses and GET
   siem/local_destination_addresses endpoints with the generated filter
   criteria to get all source addresses and local destination addresses for
   an offense.

### 09_GetOffensesForIp.py
Here we will be showing an example of how to get all offenses associated with
an IP address. For this scenario to work there must already be offenses on
the system the sample is being run against.

### 10_GetOffensesForSrcIp.html
Here we will be showing the same thing that we have done in an example 09_GetOffensesForIp.py using javascript. This script provides you detail about the offenses that are associated with source IP address. In this you will get the details (in tabular format) ,only if the source IP address is associated with more that one Offenses. This detail you cannot get from the GUI easily at one place. In this you will get the offenes that got generated in last 24 hours(time you can modify based on your convenience). When any particular offfnse is associated with multiple source IP address that become an event of interest.

The scenario demonstrates the following actions:
 - Using the GET siem/source_addresses and GET
   siem/local_destination_addresses endpoints with a filter parameter to get
   addresses associated with an IP address.
 - Building a filter criteria to be used with the GET siem/offenses endpoint
   to get offenses associated with the IP address.
